        <h2>A recipe for honeyed chicken inspired by the book series, Game of Thrones from A song of Ice and Fire.</h2>    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 - 5 # chicken giblets removed</li>
            <li>salt and pepper as needed</li>
            <li>zest of one orange</li>
            <li>juice of half an orange</li>
            <li>2 tsp - dried fennel</li>
            <li>1/3 cup - honey</li>
            <li>2 tbsp - unsalted butter room temperature</li>
            <li>handful of parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375F.</li>
            <li>Remove the giblets and any excess fat from the chicken. Make sure the bird is thoroughly dry by patting the inside and outside dry with a towel. Rub the softened butter on the skin and under.</li>
            <li>Combine the honey, zest, fennel, and orange juice. Brush the mixture over the chicken. I made sure to add a bit of the mixture inside the cavity and underneath the skin. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the orange rind in the cavity of the bird along with a handful of parsley.</li>
            <li>Roast the bird until golden brown for approximately 1 hour. The internal temperature reaches 165F. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
